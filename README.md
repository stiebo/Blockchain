Blockchains are data structures where blocks are inseparably connected. What makes blockchains so special is the security level they offer due to the way they are constructed. Blockchains are unhackable, so it makes perfect sense why cryptocurrency makes use of this technology. This project develops a multithreaded microcosm where virtual <u>**miners**</u> earn cryptocurrency ("virtual coins") and exchange messages and <u>**transactions**</u> using <u>**blockchain**</u>. They are accompanied by various <u>**messengers**</u> that also exchange encrypted messages and transactions of virtual coins with each other and with the miners through the blockchain.

### Description
Today, the most common application of blockchains is cryptocurrencies. A cryptocurrencyâ€™s blockchain contains a list of transactions: everyone can see the transactions but no one is able to change them. In addition, no one can send a transaction as another person; this is possible using digital signatures. You have actually implemented all of this functionality in the previous stages.

A miner who finds the magic number and creates a new block should be awarded some virtual money, for example, 100 virtual coins. This can be remembered in the blockchain if the block stores information about the miner who created this block. Of course, this message also should be proved, so the miner adds this information to the blockchain before starting a search for a magic number.

After that, a miner can spend these 100 virtual coins by giving them to someone else. In the real world, he can buy things and pay for them using these virtual coins instead of real money. These virtual coins go to the company that sells the things, and the company can pay salaries with these virtual coins. The circulation of these coins starts here and suddenly the virtual coins become more popular than real money!

To check how many coins a person has, the program checks all transactions to and from a user, assuming that the person started with some initial virtual coins (e.g. 100VC). The transaction should be rejected when the person tries to spend more money than he has at the moment.

### Algorithm
So, the algorithm of adding messages is the following:

- The first block doesn't contain any messages. Miners should find the magic number of this block.
- During the search of the current block, the users can send the messages to the blockchain. The blockchain should keep them in a list until miners find a magic number and a new block would be created.
- All messages must include a signature as a special part of the message. Users can generate a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The message should be signed with a private key. Then anyone can verify that the message and the signature pair is valid using a public key.
- After the creation of the new block, all new messages that were sent during the creation should be included in the new block and deleted from the list.
- After that, no more changes should be made to this block apart from the magic number. All new messages should be included in a list for the next block. The algorithm repeats from step 2.
